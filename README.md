# üé• Movie-Recommender-System
This project implements a content-based recommendation system that recommends movies similar to the input movie title based on textual similarity. The similarity is calculated using cosine similarity on processed movie metadata.

## üåü How It Works
* **Data Loading:** Merges movie and credits datasets.
* **Data Processing:** Cleans and preprocesses movie metadata to extract relevant features.
* **Tag Creation:** Combines genres, keywords, cast, crew, and overview into a single `tags` column.
* **Vectorization:** Converts the tags into numerical data using Bag of Words (BOW).
* **Similarity Calculation:** Calculates the cosine similarity between movies.
* **Recommendation:** Recommends 5 movies based on the closest cosine similarity to the input movie.
